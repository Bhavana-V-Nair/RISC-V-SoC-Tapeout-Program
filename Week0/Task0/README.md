## üìù Video Summary

The introductory video provided an overview of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program and explained the importance of documenting each step of the learning journey. It emphasized creating a GitHub repository to track progress week by week, using a clear folder structure for different tasks.

The session also highlighted the set of tools required for digital design and verification, such as **Yosys**, **Icarus Verilog**, **GTKWave**, **Ngspice**, **Magic**, and **OpenLANE**. Each tool plays a role in the end-to-end ASIC design flow‚Äîfrom synthesis to simulation and layout.

Additionally, the video guided participants on setting up a proper working environment using **Ubuntu 20.04+** in **VirtualBox**, with the necessary system specifications (6GB RAM, 50GB storage, 4 vCPUs). It stressed the importance of verifying tool installations by checking versions and capturing snapshots as proof.

Overall, the key message was:  
- Create and maintain a structured GitHub repo.  
- Install and verify essential EDA tools.  
- Document the process clearly with commands, outputs, and screenshots.
